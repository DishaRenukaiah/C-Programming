## 1. Sales of a shop.
Write a program to calculate the total sales of a shop. Given the unit price, quatity, discount rate, and sales tax rate of a particular product. The sales tax is 8.5% which should be specified using a definite constant . The output should should be displayed in proper form using appropriate formate specifier.



## 2. Sum of last two digits.
Write a progarm to extract and add the two least singnification digits of an integer using the following user dedined functions
a) Function that obtains the unit place digit of a given number.
b) Function that obtains the tenth place digit of a given number.
c) Function that adds unit and tenth place digit of a given number 
The main function should call these funcions.



## 3. Roots of the quadratic equation.
Write a program using switch statement to find all the posiible roots of a quadration equation.display switable error message for invaild inputs. write a user defined funtion  fncalc discriminant to calculate the discriminant.



## 4. Finding letter grade.
Write a program using switch to read the marks quiz1, quit2, quit3, quit4, test1, test2, and final exam of a student in one course maximum marks for each exam is given in the table 1 below . Calculate the total of all tghe marks and and print the appropriate grade to the student as given in the table 2.user must be use ceil() function to round up the value. Program calculates the internal CIE of students.



## 5. Sine series.
Write a program to find sine of an angle using the series sin(x)= x-xpower3/3!+xpower5 /5!----- for given N terms using the loop structure. Also print sin(x) using library function .



## 6. Print calender of a month.
Write a program to display the calendar of a month whose starting day of the week and number of days in the month are given as input .(0,1,2,3,...6) respectively represent sunday, monday, ..... saturday respectively. Write a function print month which takes there values as parameters and prints the calendar of the month . perform input validation as well.



## 7. Area under the curve y=log(x).
Write a program to calculate the area under the curve y=log(x) within a given left and right limit. use trapezoidal approximate . function fn trapezoidal appromation. write a user defined function fntrapaera to calculate the area of a trapezoid.




## 8. Calculating nCr.
Write a recursive C function to fine the factorial of a number ,n!.Defined by fact(n)=1, if n=0. otherwise fact(n)=n* fact(n-1). using this fuction write a program to compute the binomial co efficient nCr perform input validation as well.



## 9. Finding x power n.
Write a program in C to find the value of 'x' raised to the power 'n' using recursion 
Example: 1. x=5 n=3 x power n =125 
         2. x=2 n=-3 x power n =0.125000



## 10. Surface area and volume of cuboid
Write a program that reats the length , breadth and height of a cuboid the program has to calculate the surface arear and volume of the cuboid using the function fncalvol surface area the results are then to be display by the main function.



## 11. Set difference.
Write a program to find the difference of two seta (set have distinct elements)
A-B= {x|x belongs to A and X does not belong B}
Example: A = {1,3,5,7}
         B = {4,5,7}
         A-B ={1,3}
         
         
        
## 12. Bubble sort
Write a program that arrays N integer numbers in ascending order using bubble sort technique . write uses defined functions for the following.
(i) Function to generate N random numbers in the range 0 to 999 and store  it in an array.
(ii) Function to set N integer numbers in ascending order using bubble sort.
(iii) Function to display N integers.



## 13. Binary search.
Write a program that reads N integer numbers in sorted order and perform a search operation on input by accepting a key element from the user applying binary search method. Report the result of search as **SUCCESS** or *FAILURE* as the case may be write defined functions for the following.
(i) Function to read N integer numbers
(ii) Function to display N ineger numbers
(iii) Function to search for a key elements using binary search.



## 14. Swap smallest and largest elements in an array using pointers.
Write a program to the smallest and largest elements in an array using pointers and then swap these elements and display the resultant array.



## 15. Identity matrix.
Write a program to perform the following operations using user defined functions
(i) Read M * N matrix
(ii) Display the matrix
(iii) To check whether given matrix is identity or not identity matrix
The main function should call these functions.


## 16. Matrix multiplication.
Write program that reads two matrices A(m*n) and B(p*q) and compute the product A * B. Read matrix A in row major order and matrix B in column major order print both the input matrices and resultant with suitable headings and in matrix format. program must check the compatibility of orders of the matrices for multiplication display appropriate message in case of incompatibility.



## 17. Cassor cipher 
Write a program to implement cassor cipher input a message and then encode it by replacing each charactor in the message by a charecter that is there position ahead in the english alphabet sequence, wrap back to 'a' if the chareactor is 'z' display the encoded message decode the message using the inverse procedure and disolay.



## 18. Substring search.
Write a program to read a line of text from the keyboard and print the number of occurence of a given substring using the built in function strstr().



## 19. Finding topper of a batch.
Write a c program in c that stores the details of N number of students given by user 
The following are the information stored for each student 
(i) Name
(ii) USN
(iii) Marks scored in # subjects
Then find and display details of 
(i) Aveagre marks of each student.
(ii) Topper of the batch.



## 20. Bitwise operation.
Write a program that reads an unsigned integer and then perform the following operations using user defined function 
(i) Check given input is even or odd
(ii) to perform the swapping odf two number
(both fuction should use bitwise operators only)
